weather logic


ideas:
randomly have a weather condition after a few days:

blizzard: everything is frozen and slippery
solar flare: everything can catch on fire
thunderstorm: heavy rains will make your structures wet and lightning will come down, zapping you (or a lightning rod)
eclipse: the player will have restricted vision unless they have light sources

acid rain: happens when you pollute too much, disintegrates tools and resources on the map, can also break buildings overtime
meteor shower: meteor might fall breaking things in their path but dropping valuable resources when mined

pollen (everything grows but allergies), eruption (during solar flare)
